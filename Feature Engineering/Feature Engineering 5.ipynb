    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical values, but they are used in different scenarios based on the nature of the categorical variable.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Ordinal Encoding:**  \n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variable has a meaningful order or ranking between its categories. The categories are converted into integers that reflect this order.  \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a variable representing levels of education: High School,Bachelor's,Master's,PhD  \n",
    "we can have ranks amongst them as follows:  \n",
    "High School = 1  \n",
    "Bachelor's = 2  \n",
    "Master's = 3  \n",
    "PhD = 4  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding:**    \n",
    "Label Encoding assigns a unique integer to each category but does not account for any inherent order between the categories. This technique is useful for categorical variables where the categories are nominal (i.e., no natural ordering).  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "Consider a variable representing colors:Red,Green,Blue  \n",
    "In Label Encoding, you might assign:  \n",
    "Red = 1  \n",
    "Green = 2  \n",
    "Blue = 3  \n",
    "**Key Differences:**  \n",
    "1. Order vs. No Order: Ordinal Encoding respects and reflects the order of the categories, while Label Encoding does not imply any order.  \n",
    "2. Use Case: Use Ordinal Encoding for ordered categories (e.g., education levels, ratings) and Label Encoding for nominal categories (e.g., colors, city names).  "

    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding** is a technique that extends the concept of ordinal encoding by incorporating the target variable (i.e., the outcome variable) into the encoding process. This approach is useful when the categorical feature has a natural order that is influenced by or related to the target variable.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**How Target Guided Ordinal Encoding Works:**  \n",
    "1. Calculate the Target Mean: For each category in the feature, calculate the mean of the target variable. This gives a sense of the target's average value for each category.  \n",

    "2. Rank the Categories: Based on the mean target values, rank the categories. Categories with higher mean target values are assigned higher ordinal values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign Ordinal Values: Assign ordinal values to the categories based on their rank. The category with the highest mean target value gets the highest ordinal value, and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Replace the Original Categorical Feature: Replace the original categorical values in your dataset with the newly assigned ordinal values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example Scenario:**  \n",
    "Imagine you are working on a machine learning project to predict customer churn based on features including customer satisfaction levels. One of your features is Satisfaction Level, which can take on categorical values like:  \n",

    "Neutral,    \n",
    "Satisfied,    \n",

    "**Covariance** is a statistical measure that indicates the degree to which two variables change together. In other words, it quantifies how much two random variables vary in tandem. If the variables tend to increase and decrease together, their covariance is positive; if one tends to increase when the other decreases, the covariance is negative. If the variables do not show any consistent pattern of co-movement, the covariance is close to zero.\n",

    "2. Basis for Correlation: Covariance is foundational for calculating correlation, a standardized measure of the relationship between two variables. Correlation adjusts covariance for the scale of the variables, providing a dimensionless measure of association.  \n",

    "3. Portfolio Theory: In finance, covariance is used to assess the risk and return of investment portfolios. It helps in understanding how the returns on different assets in a portfolio move relative to each other, which is crucial for diversification strategies.  \n",
