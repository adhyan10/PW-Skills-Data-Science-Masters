    "**Ans: API stands for Application Programming Interface.An application programming interface, or API, enables companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. This allows services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other’s data and functionality through a documented interface. Developers don't need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products and services.**  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Automation: with APIs, computers rather than people can manage the work. Through APIs, agencies can update work flows to make them quicker and more productive.**  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Application: because APIs can access the app components, the delivery of services and information is more flexible.**  \n",
    " \n",
    "**More scope: with an API an application layer can be created which can be used to distribute information and services to new audiences which can be personalized to create custom user experiences.**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Efficiency: when access is provided to an API, the content generated can be published automatically and is available for every channel. It allows it to be shared and distributed more easily.**  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Integration: APIs allow content to be embedded from any site or application more easily. This guarantees more fluid information delivery and an integrated user experience.**  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Personalization: through APIs any user or company can customize the content and services that they use the most.**  \n",
    " \n",
    "**Adaptation: needs change over time and APIs help to anticipate changes. When working with this technology, data migration is supported better, and the information is reviewed more closely. In short, APIs make service provision more flexible.**  "
